# Optimization-A-Balanced-Meal-in-College

## Introduction
The project will involve investigating the following dataset:
The Grain Bowl Station macronutrients at Union Market

We want apply a linear programming model to solve college diet problem. Here, we mainly consider macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. We will only use the grain bowl (priced by weight) at Union Market on the OSU campus as an example of where the student can eat from. We get our data about the grain bowl station macronutrients on the website Net Nutrition. Given a student’s gender, height, weight, and age, type of meal, and activity level we can calculate the recommended calories and macronutrients they need to take each day from the website Macro Calculator. Since our college students have limited budgets, our objective is to minimize the cost of the meal.
